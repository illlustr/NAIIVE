NAIIVE is a decentralized organization operating across various fields.

Initially, NAIIVE was established in response to the opportunities where numerous talented individuals were underappreciated, lacked connections, or had limited choices, hindering their ability to nurture and capitalize on their talents.

One of the challenges for clients lies in the obscurity, difficulty in locating, lack of guarantees, or doubts associated with these talents, leading to missed opportunities and deals.

NAIIVE serves as an intermediary and a guarantor, facilitating collaboration between clients and these talents, ensuring that they can fully leverage their skills, while clients receive assurances regarding the sustainability of their projects.
