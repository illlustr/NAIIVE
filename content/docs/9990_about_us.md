NAIIVE is a decentralized Organization / Company operating in various fields.

initialy NAIIVE was formed by opportunities where many talents were underappreciated / had no connections / had no choice which ultimately hampered or stopped these talents from improving or living with their talents.

one of the problems for clients are that these talents don't have a name yet / difficult to find / don't have guarantees / or doubtful, which ultimately results in lost opportunities / deals.

NAIIVE is present as a intermediary, and also a guarantor for clients and these talents to work according to their talents and clients get guarantees for the sustainability of their projects.
