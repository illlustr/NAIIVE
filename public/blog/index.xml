&lt;p>Automation and application are related and it can be quite challenging to determine whether a project is automation or application.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>due to our commitment it is most likely that we are building interface on top of the automation service, therefore we created a small standard that can be one of the considerations in determining whether a project is included in the automation or application category.&lt;/p>
