The primary objective was to swiftly incorporate state-of-the-art Artificial Intelligence technology for proof of concept and as a fundamental exercise in mobile device design.\nSubsequently, as development progressed and further research was conducted, the decision was made to expand its functionality into a fully functional tool accessible for everyone.\nProblem While Artificial Image Generators have become more accessible to the general public, it remains evident that using such programs can still be costly. Users typically need a powerful GPU or must invest financially to make the software truly \u0026ldquo;usable.\u0026rdquo; Even when users can access it for free, there\u0026rsquo;s often a trade-off, such as watching ads or providing their data for undisclosed purposes.\nThis practice is understandable because developers incur significant expenses in operating Artificial Intelligence systems. These costs include not only bandwidth and electricity but also infrastructure maintenance. Moreover, serving hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of requests daily further compounds the financial challenges.\nℹ️ Article work in progress.
