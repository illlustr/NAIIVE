      <description>info Thread work in progress [WIP]. NAIIVE is a decentralized Organization / Company operating in various fields.
initialy NAIIVE was formed by opportunities where many talents were underappreciated / had no connections / had no choice which ultimately hampered or stopped these talents from improving or living with their talents.
one of the problems for clients are that these talents don&amp;rsquo;t have a name yet / difficult to find / don&amp;rsquo;t have guarantees / or doubtful, which ultimately results in lost opportunities / deals.</description>
